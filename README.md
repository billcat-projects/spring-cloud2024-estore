# Spring Cloud 2023.0.x and Frontend(react.js | vue.js | angular)

This is a work in progress.

I will create `spring-cloud2025-estore` next year, hence use `cloud2024` in the name.

1. Spring Cloud 2023.0.0
2. Spring Authorization Server 1.2.3
3. Frontend: React.js 18 + Vue.js 3 + Angular 17
4. OpenID Connect with PKCE

## Up and running

This multi-module project is created by my plugin [billcat-maven-archetypes](https://github.com/billcat-projects/billcat-maven-archetypes), you can install it and use locally. It's very simple to use.

```shell
cd spring-cloud2024-estore
mvn clean install
```
